## 📜 Early History of Java (1991–1995)

### 🔹 1991 – The Beginning (Green Project)

Java’s journey began in **1991** at **Sun Microsystems**, a technology company based in the United States.

- A small team of engineers led by **James Gosling**, **Mike Sheridan**, and **Patrick Naughton** started a research initiative called the **Green Project**.
- The goal was to create a programming language for **consumer electronic devices** like TVs, set-top boxes, and embedded systems.
- At that time, existing languages such as C and C++ were not suitable for these devices due to hardware limitations and security issues.

---

### 🔹 1992–1994 – Development Phase

- During this period, the team developed a new language that was:
  - Platform independent
  - Secure
  - Lightweight
- The language used a **virtual machine concept**, allowing programs to run on different devices without modification.
- A prototype called **Star7** (a handheld home controller) was built to demonstrate the language.

---

### 🔹 Initial Name – “Oak”

- The original name of Java was **Oak**.
- It was named after an **oak tree** that stood outside James Gosling’s office.
- Oak represented **strength and longevity**, aligning with the vision of the language.

### 🔹 Why the Name Changed to “Java”

- The name **Oak** was already trademarked by another company.
- The team brainstormed alternative names.
- During coffee breaks, they frequently drank **Java coffee**.
- The name **Java** was chosen because it was:
  - Short
  - Unique
  - Easy to remember
  - Associated with energy and creativity ☕

### 🔹 1995 – Public Release of Java

- In **1995**, Sun Microsystems officially released Java to the public.
- Java was introduced with the slogan:

  **“Write Once, Run Anywhere”**

- One of Java’s first major demonstrations was its ability to run **interactive applets inside web browsers**.
- This feature made Java extremely popular during the early days of the internet.

---

### 🔹 Company Behind Java

- **Sun Microsystems** originally owned and developed Java.
- In **2010**, **Oracle Corporation** acquired Sun Microsystems.
- Java is now maintained by **Oracle**, along with contributions from the global open-source community.
