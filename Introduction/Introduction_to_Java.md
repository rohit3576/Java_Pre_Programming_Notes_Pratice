# ☕ Introduction to Java

## What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, class-based programming language**.  
It is designed to be **simple, secure, portable, and platform-independent**.

Java follows the principle:

**“Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”**

This means Java programs can run on any system that has a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

## First Java Program (Printing Output)

To print something in Java, we use the `System.out.println()` statement.

### Example:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
